- ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone,  
Iâ€™m Rahul Venkatesh . I am an aspiring engineer with interest in areas such as Electrical Controls, Automation, Instrumentation and Robotics.

Instruments have always fascinated me since my childhood. I have always wondered since childhood how does each instrument possess unique behaviour
and differeent characteristics. This piqued my interest in pursuing Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering during my 
undergraduate studies. The fascination for instruments fuelled  in me more to pursue Masterâ€™s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Concordia University, 
Montreal. I specialized in the field of Systems and Control during my masterâ€™s program. I have good exeperience in design, development, configuration,
commissioning and process visualization of different control systems such as PLC, SCADA and HMI's. I am looking forward to an opportunity that aligns 
with my professional goals.
